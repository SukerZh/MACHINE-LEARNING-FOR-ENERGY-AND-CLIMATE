# Machine-Learning-For-Energy-And-Climate
PROJECT: VRE ASSESSMENT AND FORECAST


## Project pre-presentation instructions
The data provided for the projects is available from Moodle as zip files for each subject:

WEATHER: weather.zip;
ENSO: el_nino.zip;
VRE: climate_france.zip and energy_france.zip).
If you do not have access to Moodle, you can also download the data from the shared directory provided by your professors. If this is not the case, please ask them for the link to this directory.

You will have about half of the second to last and all of the last class to work on the projects, which is not that much. It is thus important that you understand well the project objective, the data that you have access to and that you make sure that you are heading in the right direction from the start. This is why we ask you to prepare a short oral presentation (about 3 minutes long) for Class #7. It should include :

A well-defined objective or research question that requires producing results with a machine learning methodology. This objective should be more precise that the general problematic that we presented and may thus vary between groups working on the same topic.
A motivation and description of the machine learning methodology that you plan to apply (unsupervised/supervised, feature extraction method(s), model(s), loss function(s), complexity management, evaluation method...). You should try different strategies, starting from the simplest one and progressively increasing the complexity to improve or complement your results. However, the most important is that you apply the full methodology and that you are able to properly evaluate the quality of your results and the robustness of your conclusions.
A precise description of the data (inputs, targets...) and a broad assessment of its quality (sources of uncertainty, time/spatial step, coverage...), and how you plan to use each dataset or not.
If you plan to use data not provided by us, also provide the actual data files and the source of the data. Note that using your own data is risky and will not be valued by us. Do it only if you feel confident that you can handle the data quickly, that it is of good quality and that it will prove useful to your project.
You should not prepare slides as your presentation will take the form of a short discussion between your professors and your group during class.

Please take this exercise very seriously. First because framing the problem and designing the method is a key step in any scientific work. Second because it will help you to ensure that you spend well the little time you have to work on the projects and prevent you from heading to a dead end and a bad grade.

If your group is not able to attend Class #7, please let your professor know and he or she will plan your pre-presentation for the end of Class #6. For the above reasons, it is very important that you do your pre-presentation before Class #8 since you will then start working on the projects in class.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
